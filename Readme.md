### Welcome to the MusicTools application suite

This repository includes a couple of tools I use for my musical performance and research.

MidiSink is a tool I use on macOS for my one-man band performances (see e.g. http://rochus-keller.ch/?p=1221); when started, it automatically records all MIDI information on all input ports present on the system. The tool uses an efficient format, which interleafes and timestamps all incoming MIDI data and logs them to a single file. There is also a function to convert these files to regular MIDI standard files suited to be imported e.g. to Logic Pro.

ScaleAnalyzer is a tool which can calculate all possible scales and different subsets of it; scales can be played either to a MIDI port or a sound font.

Here is a screenshot of ScaleAnalyzer

VirtualPiano is a tool which presents a virtual MIDI input port to the local environment. I use it e.g. to play MIDI data from Common Music algorithms.

More to come.

Note that these tools are work in progress.
